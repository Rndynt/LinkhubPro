please read and act on this exactly:
Fix the following issues and implement the requested improvements:
Landing page — Pricing section: several pricing items look unattractive because borders and the inner backgrounds are messy. Do not use plain border lines that look rigid or unappealing. Replace those border outlines with subtle shadows and clean backgrounds so the pricing cards are eye-catching and well-aligned. Remove the thin, harsh border-lines; use elevation (box-shadow), proper padding, and consistent spacing instead.
Analytics menu: the Top Performing Pages / Links section is not mobile-responsive and overflows its container. Fix the layout so the section is fully responsive (mobile-first) and content does not escape its section.
Admin Panel: User Management, Recent Subscriptions, and Quick Actions components are not mobile-responsive and overflow their sections on small screens. Fix layout, wrapping, and spacing so these modules work correctly on mobile and desktop.
Endpoint Monitor: the items under Endpoint Status overflow and are not responsive. Ensure endpoint items wrap/stack properly, use responsive grid/flex behavior, and remain contained within their section.
Sidebar navigation state bug: after selecting Admin Panel and then Endpoint Monitor, the sidebar marks two items as active at once (both show as checked/active). Fix routing / active-link logic so only the correct single menu item is marked active.
Admin menus: if necessary, add and explicitly expose the full set of administration menus. There should be additional manageable admin pages — review available admin features and ensure the sidebar/menu lists every appropriate admin section (and their access control).
Pages menu: creating pages currently throws an error. Investigate the root cause of the create-pages error and fix it end-to-end (frontend form validation, API request, backend handler, DB write, and error handling).
Remove hardcoded/dummy data: ensure no features depend on hardcoded dummy data. All UI and metrics must use real data from the database — dashboard metrics, analytics, pages, domains, and other data-driven components must reflect real DB values only (no UI-only hardcoded placeholders). Audit the codebase for any hardcoded fixtures and replace with real data flows.
Demo pages for landing: create a polished set of demo pages/links/blocks for the landing page “Visit Demo” flow. Requirements:
Build attractive demo pages (blocks, link blocks, CTA, grid/list) that showcase the product.
Ensure the demo data is stored in the database (not just front-end).
Add seeders so the demo data is re-created automatically after a database reset/migration.
Wire the landing page “Visit Demo” link to open the demo page with working block/link features and realistic demo content.
Final deliverable requirements:
Perform a thorough, well-structured fix and deep analysis of root causes for each issue.
Provide a concise report of what you changed, why, and where (files/lines or PR/commit references).
Ensure all fixes are mobile-first and desktop-responsive, follow the existing design system (Tailwind + shadcn/ui as requested), and eliminate brittle custom CSS that causes global breakage.
Make sure typography, colors, spacing, and component states (hover/active/disabled) are restored and consistent across the app.
Add/restore seeders for demo content and document how to re-seed the demo data.
Act on this exactly and deliver the fixes, plus the analysis/report of changes made.
